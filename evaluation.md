## Evaluation Criteria

- Structural consistency
- Relevance
- Repeatability
- Automation readiness

## Comparison

| Criterion | Prompt A | Prompt B |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Structure | Unstable | Stable |
| Filler content | Frequent | Minimal |
| Repeatability | Low | High |
| Automation-ready | No | Yes |
## Evidence From Model Outputs

Prompt A produced variable formats and narrative-style responses,
making automated processing unreliable.

Prompt B consistently followed the predefined structure across runs,
demonstrating higher controllability and repeatability.

## Conclusion
Prompt B was selected due to higher controllability and
consistent output across multiple runs.
